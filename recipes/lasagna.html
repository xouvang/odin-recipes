    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is one of my favorite Italian dishes that I make for my fiancee. I'm proud to say it's one of my biggest achievements in my cooking career. There's just something so amazing when it comes to home made food. Whenever she orders beef lasagna at a restaurant, she always makes fun and say I make it better. This is a warm, comforting dinner, and can feed a crowd. <br>
    This is a classic homemade lasagna recipe mdae with layers of gooey melted mozzarella cheese, a parmesan ricotta cheese, and a robust tomato meat sauce. It is perfect for weeknight dinners, potlucks, or to take to friends who just had a baby. This lasagna recipe can be frozen so it is perfect to made ahead of time. It also makes flavorful leftovers.
